# Temtem Wiki App

This app is a fan-made project that aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date encyclopedia for the massively multiplayer creature-collecting game Temtem.

## Features
- Search for Temtem by name, type, or trait to find detailed information about each creature.
- View a Temtem's stats, strengths and weaknesses, locations, and more.
- Learn about the different moves and techniques each Temtem can learn, and see which ones are the most effective.

## Contribute

This app is a community-driven project, and I welcome contributions from other Temtem fans. If you have information or updates to share, please open a pull request.
